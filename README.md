# Largemon
A Largemon generator and fight simulator bullit in C++

To compile and run this program you need to install SDL2 libraries and their extensions.

If on Ubuntu/Debian then you can run these commands (possibly as root) to install the base SDL libraries:

apt-get install libsdl-dev
apt-get install libsdl2-dev

And to install the extention libraries:

apt-get install libsdl2-image-dev
apt-get install libsdl2-ttf-dev
apt-get install libsdl2-mixer-dev
